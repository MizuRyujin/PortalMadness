This project is a 2D puzzle platformer where you go to different areas and test your platforming skills while solving small puzzles in order to progress.

The project is also a recreation of an university assignment created in the game [MakerKing](https://makerkinggame.com/) (Green Frisbee Games Inc. )
as a game design challenge to create a puzzle level with the pieces available within MakerKing.

[Click here for a showcase of the previous result](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1theBLbaSMBxYKEp99QXuauqDHJs5b1dA/view), the level ID is 60463 under the username Testbug.
